2011-12-26,5,ive tried all sorts of bottled and canned pizza sauces for years none were better than mediocre and some were really awful i would always go back to my polpo which i make with a base of muir glen diced tomatoes tasty but still would dump too much water on the crust while baking finally tried the pastorelli boy is it goodbr good tomatoey flavor not overherbed or garliced not salty and it held together when cooking rather than soggying up my crust my new best tomato friend tb or so wii suffice for a pizza great stuff,negative,other

2012-05-12,2,this is a really easy way to make terrible iced tea sometimes convenience outweighs taste but not always what this product doesnt tell you before you buy it is that the ingredients are black tea with tea extract hibiscus and citric acid its not just tea and it doesnt taste like just tea either it tastes like powdered iced tea from a jar it has an overtaste of lemon thats probably the citric acid and that fake tea flavor that comes from powdered iced tea mix ill probably drink it when its really convenient but i wont serve it to friends and i wont drink it if i have time to make a glass of real tea and pour it over ice,negative,other

2009-02-16,1,i found this flavor of primal strips spicy hot mushroom to be one of the most salty foods i have ever tasted it was an overwhelming salt taste and this flavor is just not for me i could not eat more than one this brands teriyaki flavor is better the jerky is a bit soft thin and oily it has a strange texture that breaks into pieces that are more mushy than chewy it is not as satisfying as the other mock meat products ive tried examples are listed below i suggest finding a way to taste one piece of this before committing to buy an entire casebr br for comparison i would recommend stonewalls jerquee soy vegetarian available on amazon stonewalls has a better chewermeatier texture soft enough to bite into but drier and firm enough to chew for a short while it comes in flavors none of which were unpleasant like this primal strips flavorbr br another tasty soymeatless similar product is manna soy gourmet meatless flavors on amazon this comes in big pound bags and flavors it starts out softer than jerky but can be microwaved into dryer chewy strips that are very satisfying very versatile for vegetarianvegan diets and a good value for price,negative,pricing
